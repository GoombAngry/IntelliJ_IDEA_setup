## Install IntelliJ IDEA via its zip file
***It is important to have a version of Java installed on our PC to be able to continue the installation!***
1. The first thing we will do is download the compressed file.
   
2. Once downloaded, we save this script and the file that we have downloaded in an empty folder (so that the explanation is as clear as possible) and we open a terminal inside that folder.

3. Now we execute the script with sudo(If you have problems running it, you must give it execution permissions), indicating the exact name of the compressed file.

4. In the installation process it tells us if we want to configure x users of the system so that they can run the IDE.

5. Once it finishes we must close the terminal and open a new one and execute the "idea" command.

### Advice
***If you want to close the terminal and the program does not close, run it like this**
